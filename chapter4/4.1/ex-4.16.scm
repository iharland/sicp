;; Exercise 4.16
;;
;; In this exercise we implement the method just described for
;; interpreting internal definitions.
;; We assume that the evaluator supports let (see exercise 4.6).
;;
;; a. Change lookup-variable-value (section 4.1.3) to signal
;;    an error if the value it finds is the symbol *unassigned*.
;;
;; b. Write a procedure scan-out-defines that takes a procedure body
;;    and returns an equivalent one that has no internal definitions,
;;    by making the transformation described above.
;;
;; c. Install scan-out-defines in the interpreter, either in
;;    make-procedure or in procedure-body (see section 4.1.3).
;;    Which place is better? Why?


;; See: environment.scm
;;      eval-lambda.scm
;;      letrec.scm (as an alternative to inner definitions)
